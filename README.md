# Abstract:
 This project demonstrates the many uses of the PyCaret library with machine learning. PyCare allows the creation of models, training, and evaluating of models with ease allowing developers to obtain data while not needing to spend too much time coding.
 The notebook contains steps on how to set up the PyCaret library, importing datasets, and evaluating the data set with many different ML models specifically for multiclass classification.
 Using a data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/22/chess+king+rook+vs+king+pawn) we are able to obtain data on many different models such as accuracy, AUC, recall, precision, F1 score, kappa, and MCC
